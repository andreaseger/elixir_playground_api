# ApiPlayground

To start your new Phoenix application you have to:

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Start Phoenix router with `mix phoenix.start`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.


## Notes

* If you choose to change the application's structure, you could manually start the router from your code like this `ApiPlayground.Router.start`

some seemingly still hard bits in elixir (like gettings the full request body)
